# Rotten-Tomatoes-Movies
Hi there,  I’m the host of a movie reviews podcast and I’m currently making an episode about movie review aggregators.  I found this data set from Rotten Tomatoes (inside the .ipynb file that I’ve attached). Could you dig into the data and share any interesting insights that you find? My audience loves fun facts about movies.  Thank you!
